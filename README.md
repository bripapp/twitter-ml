# Twitter Machine
This project is part of the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp at Johns Hopkins University. 

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is find hate speech in tweets. Using machine learning to create an algorithm that identifies hatefuls speech in the body of a tweet and returning the results  (Describe the main goals of the project and potential civic impact. Limit to a short paragraph, 3-6 Sentences but ensure it offers a clear overview)

## Project Description
We set out to create a model for machine learning that will use Tweepy, the Twitter API, to seach for tweets based on a user input and return a list of tweets and whether or not they contain hate speach. We wanted to see how much hate is on Twitter. 

Being very new to Machine Learning we pulled heavily from other projects and sources to coble together this model. It is not perfect and needs fine tuning but it does what we set out to do. We ran out of time and would like to revisit the project in the future.
